                    <h2>You would't belive if I told you</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a short story about a boy named as me. The story starts in the beginning as any other story would start. 
                 But let's jump ahead because i do not have all day to write all those years accordingly how it truly happened.
                  That would take simply the same amount of time as it actually took to live it. Maybe more because the time of writing 
                  has to be slowing down things. Fast Forward then.
                  So now the story is here in the moment where the 
                 boy tries to write something about himself but nothing really comes to his mind the clock is ticking and the presents progressing 
                 toward the future. 
                 And who knows how that would look like.
                  So this is it for now.
                 Later on you can find out more. If there is something else you would like to know. You can
                 contact me here:
                 <span class="surprise">galabotri@somtfhifsdfng.ple</span> or just think really hard,
                 maybe telepathy also an option. But you never know if you never try!

                <h3>Logic Gate</h3>

                <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical
                    operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
                <h3>ASCII</h3>
                <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand
                    numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of
                    some sort.</p>
                <h3>RAM</h3>
                <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase
                    the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in
                    almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
                <h3>Programming languages</h3>
                <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of
                    output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs
                    that implement specific algorithms.</p>
                <h3>The Domain Name System (DNS)</h3>
                <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to
                    the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to
                    each of the participating entities.</p>
                <h3>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h3>
                <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the
                    foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or
                    transfer hypertext.</p>
